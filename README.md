# 🔐 Shoto Password Hasher

> Python tool for generating SHOTO password hashes and writing them into an XML configuration file.

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a **SHOTO password hash generator** with a fixed salt.  
It produces a `pwd.xml` file containing the hash in all relevant password fields.

The generator takes:

* Password input
* Optional config folder (default `config`)

…and produces a valid hashed XML using:

* Fixed-salt MD5 hashing
* Double MD5 hashing pipeline
* Automatic config folder creation
* Standardized XML output

---

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔹 Fully offline (no API required)  
* 🔹 Deterministic output  
* 🔹 Fixed-salt MD5 hashing (`LD|SD`)  
* 🔹 Automatic creation of `config/pwd.xml`  
* 🔹 CLI-based interactive usage  
* 🔹 Clean and documented code

## 🔬 Algorithm Flow


INPUT (password)
↓
checksum()
↓
MD5 (uppercase) + fixed salt LD|SD
↓
MD5 final (uppercase)
↓
write_pwd_xml() → config/pwd.xml


---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/ShotoHasher.git
cd ShotoHasher
▶️ Usage
python shoto_hasher.py

Enter your password when prompted.
The pwd.xml file will be created automatically in the config folder.

Example
python shoto_hasher.py

Output:

config/
└── pwd.xml  ← generated automatically
🔑 Parameters
Param	Description
password	User input password
config_folder	Folder where pwd.xml will be generated (default: config)
🧪 Technical Details
Hash is generated in 2 steps:
MD5 of password (uppercase)
Concatenated with fixed salt LD|SD → MD5 final (uppercase)
Final hash is written in all password fields of pwd.xml
Folder config is created automatically if it does not exist
